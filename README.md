# ioc-rix-RP100

This repository provides a **generic StreamDevice IOC** skeleton. It does not control any actual device, but is meant to be copied and customized to implement an IOC communicating with a text-based protocol device over TCP/IP.

---
## What is a Common IOC?

A **Common IOC** defines a general device type, along with the protocol and methods used to interact with devices of that type. It is not tied to a specific deployed device.

- Use a **Common IOC** to cover all devices of a given type/protocol.
- Use a **Child IOC** to deploy a specific instance of a device.

> **Note:**  
> Only create a new Common IOC if the device/protocol you want to use is not already covered by another Common IOC.


## Getting Started: Making This Useful

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Please refer to the [IOC Design and Deployment Guide](https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/spaces/PCDS/pages/92871122/IOC+Design+and+Deployment+Guide) for extensive instructions. The steps here are an abridged version.

> **Note:**  
> "gsd" is just a placeholder. When making your IOC, use a unique and descriptive device name, and update all file names and references accordingly.

## Steps to Customize This IOC

1.  Use this template to create a new repo in pcds devices. After forking this to your own profile, clone this into  `/cds/group/pcds/epics-dev/[username]/ioc/common/[manufacturer]/` during development.

1. **Define Protocol & Database**
    - Rename files `app/srcProtocol/gsd.proto` and `app/Db/gsd.db` to match your project/device name.
    - Edit the protocol file for your device's communication needs. See the [StreamDevice Protocol Guide](https://paulscherrerinstitute.github.io/StreamDevice/) for help in writing the protocol.
    - For general EPICS records reference see [EPICS record types](https://epics.anl.gov/base/R7-0/4-docs/RecordReference.html).

2. **Autosave**
    - `app/Db/gsd.req` lists PVs to autosave. Rename and update for your project.

3. **Archiving**
    - `app/Db/gsd.archive` lists PVs and archive periods. Rename and update.

4. **User Interface (GUI)**
    - Create a `[gsd]Screens/` folder for your PyDM screens or other GUIs.
    - Use macro substitutions (e.g., `${prefix}:`) when defining channels.
    - Update `iocBoot/templates/pydm-ioc.cmd`.
    - *EDM screens* are deprecated, but you can invoke them with `iocBoot/templates/edm-ioc.cmd` if needed.

5. **Update Makefiles and Scripts**
    - Change all references from "gsd" to your device name.
    - There are a lot of places you will need to change the name. It is helpful to use a find_and_replace tool for "gsd"
   - Ensure `RELEASE_SITE` and module versions in `config/RELEASE` are current

6. **Create Test/Example Child IOC**
    - Child IOCs are generally kept in separate "child" repositories by deployment area/hutch. However, a test/example child in the `children/` folder is helpful for development.
    - The child config file holds device-specific info (port number, IP, location, etc.).
    - The child config filename **must match** the IOC process name in `ioc-manager`.
    - Create separate config files for each IOC process you run (one process can control multiple devices).

    > **Note:** For a few one-off child IOCs, you can keep them in this folder â€” but that's not best practice.

## Build & Deployment

### Building

All compilation and macro expansion uses `make`:

```bash
# Build both parent and child IOCs (from repo root)
make

# Delete all build files
make clean

# Clean and build in one step
make rebuild
```

### Running
The build creates a launch script for each child in:
> /children/build/iocBoot/[ioc_name]/st.cmd

You can run this script directly to start the IOC, but using [IOC Manager](https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/spaces/PCDS/pages/177176665/IOC+Manager+Staff+Guide) is preferred for ioc process management. Ioc manager will also handle [adding the archive files to the archiver for you](https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/spaces/timing/pages/433984366/Using+the+Archiver+Scripts+and+Checking+PV+Status).

### Deployment

- Use the `ioc-deploy` script for deployment.

=======
What needs to be added to make this a useful IOC?
    - app/srcProtocol/rp100.proto needs to have a protocol added to it.
    - app/Db/rp100.db needs to have records added that use this protocol.
    - app/Db/rp100.req needs to have a list of PVs for autosaving.
    - app/Db/rp100.archive needs to have a list of PVs and periods for
      archiving.
    - rp100Screens needs to have a top level screen defined.
    - iocBoot/templates/edm-ioc.sh needs to be changed to call edm
      on this top-level screen.

In general, "rp100" is not the greatest name for things in the IOC.  You
might want to copy these files, and then go through and change these to
names more appropriate to the actual IOC being developed.
